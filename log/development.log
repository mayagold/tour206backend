Being based simultaneously in Toulouse, France and on stages across the world makes this electronic musician stand out. With inspirations far afield from music - a painting, the weather, a dream - in her craft, Chloé Herry’s derivations are difficult to trace. Under the broad structure of electronic and bass music, and informed by sound the world over, Clozee finds her best fit in World Bass’ corner.\nCloZee has performed on many continents: from Coachella to India, on four US Tours, and everywhere around her native France. She is a standout on the roster of her labels, Gravitas Recordings & Otodayo Records. Followers in many languages drive streams counted in millions. But art’s ability to transport others is this talented producer’s special magic - manifest whenever someone presses play.\nIn the way the clean curve of a Japanese roof is understated and exotic, CloZee pulls her power from a bold simplicity. Her classical guitar roots allow her an informed, melodic space that draws influence from flamenco to edIT of The Glitch Mob. This melting pot of instrumentation and cinematic flair puts listeners in a mood to move, with international crowds now cultivating the evolution of her genre. Chloé says she rarely lays down only electronic sounds. Her favorite sources are organic and real.\nTo describe her life, CloZee grins and dramatizes her mind exploding. With traction growing stateside, she is set to expand far beyond the transformational festivals and tours where she grew the same roots that nourished Bassnectar, Beats Antique, and Bonobo. CloZee is breaking through the canopy and into the sun. Come see her fly\n\n\n\n\n", "user_id"=>1}}

But, when he opens his mouth and lets out that high lonesome vocal, you can hear him loud and clear.His debut solo album, Folk Singer Vol. 1, was produced by David Rawlings at Woodland Sound Studios, the studio he co-owns with associate producer Gillian Welch in Nashville, TN, over the course of a pair of two-day sessions, for their own Acony Records label. The album spans ten songs from the American folk songbook ranging from standards like “Midnight Special,” “Mexican Cowboy” and Richard “Rabbit” Brown’s “James Alley Blues” to the more obscure, like Memphis Slim’s 12-bar blues, “Mother Earth,” Gus Cannon and the Jug Stompers’ “Bring it With You When You Come,” Land Norris’ double-entendre kids chant, “Kitty Puss” and St. Louis bluesman Charley Jordan’s sing-song “Keep It Clean.” Like the music, Willie can be murderous, bawdy or lustful, sometimes in the course of a single song, with a sly sense of humor that cuts to the quick. He counters a
  ful bravado with the tragic fragility of one who has been wounded.“There’s a lot of weight in the way Willie performs,” says Rawlings, longtime friend and producer of Watson’s previous band, Old Crow Medicine Show. “He’s had some tragedy in his life, which has informed his art. There’s an emotional edge to what he does because of who he is as a human being. He’s the only one of his generation I listen to who can make me forget these songs were ever sung before.”\"\n\n\nABOUT BEDOUINE: \"Like her name implies, Bedouine's music has a nomadic heart. Sweeping, hypnotic. Esoteric yet familiar. It is untethered to place because its home is everywhere.Bedouine's sound is for the modern cyber gypsy, dipping a curious toe in the swaying Mediterranean before caravaning for weeks across the deserts of the Middle East, and finally catching a redeye back to L.A. for a pre-dawn Southern California stroll.\"It's in my roots,\" Bedouine says over a tenuous Skype connection from Saudi Arabia. \"I love exploring different places and sounds. My childhood was this amalgamation of different cultures, so I've never really belonged to a particular place. But being nomadic can be a beautiful thing if you're accepting of it -- not knowing exactly what you're doing or where you're going, but with conviction. Being experimental, even with your intentions.\"An outsider and an introvert, Bedouine prefers anonymity but loves making music enough to share hers with anyone willing to listen -- even if it means confronting her fears. An aversion to the spotlight led her away from the stage for several years, where she worked from the shadows, composing music for independent films and art installations until something unexpected happened -- she wound up in Los Angeles and experienced the opposite of the cliché.\"The joy I get from making music has nothing to do with any kind of recognition,\" Bedouine says, \"so when I moved to L.A., I had no intention of pursuing music as a career. But then I started meeting so many inspiring people -- talented musicians who were living these double lives, going out on the road with successful bands and playing stadiums, and then coming home to this amazing scene and playing all these great little clubs and bars. It made the idea of starting over with my music less intimidating, and it made me more comfortable with the idea of performing. L.A. actually made me less jaded.\"She soon fell in with the tight-knit community of performers in her Echo Park neighborhood, spending nights trading songs and listening to records with some of L.A.'s best underground artists. \"One of my favorite ways to hang out with people,\" Bedouine says, \"is to take turns listening to each other's music, bouncing ideas back and forth.\"It was on just such a night that she met collaborator Jake Blanton (The Killers, Father John Misty, Jenny O.), with whom she would record the songs for her new self-titled EP.The two co-wrote \"The City,\" and put together a short yet memorable set of songs propelled by insistent, mesmerizing beats, and anchored by chiming guitar, daydreamy piano and above all, Bedouine's unforgettable voice. Impressionistic, her languid vocals swirl into the ether, another color in the palette, another instrument in the band. Her words roll soft off the tongue, careful brushstrokes, oil paint swept across a canvas. The music is beautiful and striking, always revelling quietly in its search for some enigmatic unknown just out of reach. There is no ego here, no filter between Bedouine's heart and her songs.\n\nMORE EVENT INFO:\n- We have a mix of normal chairs, some tall chairs, and standing room in back if the show sells out.- Seating is not reserved.- Fremont Abbey is ADA accessible on either level.- We are an all ages venue. - Please refrain from talking or texting during the show.- Kids 10 & under are free at Abbey Arts concerts & arts events unless noted.\n\nABBEY ARTS, SEATTLE | NONPROFIT 501C3, NON-RELIGIOUS, EST. 2005Presenting welcoming music, arts & cultural experiences for people of all ages & incomes.\nWe support low income families, veterans, and humanitarian nonprofit workers with free event tickets. http://www.fremontabbey.org/artsconnect  \nVenue rental info & more: http://www.fremontabbey.org/rent Concert & events calendar: http://www.abbeyarts.me\n Home Venue: Fremont Abbey, 4272 Fremont Ave North, Seattle, WA 98103 / 206-414-8325 Ballard Homestead: 6541 Jones Ave NW, Seattle\n\nAll ticket sales are final.", "user_id"=>1}}

But, when he opens his mouth and lets out that high lonesome vocal, you can hear him loud and clear.His debut solo album, Folk Singer Vol. 1, was produced by David Rawlings at Woodland Sound Studios, the studio he co-owns with associate producer Gillian Welch in Nashville, TN, over the course of a pair of two-day sessions, for their own Acony Records label. The album spans ten songs from the American folk songbook ranging from standards like “Midnight Special,” “Mexican Cowboy” and Richard “Rabbit” Brown’s “James Alley Blues” to the more obscure, like Memphis Slim’s 12-bar blues, “Mother Earth,” Gus Cannon and the Jug Stompers’ “Bring it With You When You Come,” Land Norris’ double-entendre kids chant, “Kitty Puss” and St. Louis bluesman Charley Jordan’s sing-song “Keep It Clean.” Like the music, Willie can be murderous, bawdy or lustful, sometimes in the course of a single song, with a sly sense of humor that cuts to the quick. He counters a masterful bravado with the tragic fragility of one who has been wounded.“There’s a lot of weight in the way Willie performs,” says Rawlings, longtime friend and producer of Watson’s previous band, Old Crow Medicine Show. “He’s had some tragedy in his life, which has informed his art. There’s an emotional edge to what he does because of who he is as a human being. He’s the only one of his generation I listen to who can make me forget these songs were ever sung before.”\"\n\n\nABOUT BEDOUINE: \"Like her name implies, Bedouine's music has a nomadic heart. Sweeping, hypnotic. Esoteric yet familiar. It is untethered to place because its home is everywhere.Bedouine's sound is for the modern cyber gypsy, dipping a curious toe in the swaying Mediterranean before caravaning for weeks across the deserts of the Middle East, and finally catching a redeye back to L.A. for a pre-dawn Southern California stroll.\"It's in my roots,\" Bedouine says over a tenuous Skype connection from Saudi Arabia. \"I love exploring different places and sounds. My childhood was this amalgamation of different cultures, so I've never really belonged to a particular place. But being nomadic can be a beautiful thing if you're accepting of it -- not knowing exactly what you're doing or where you're going, but with conviction. Being experimental, even with your intentions.\"An outsider and an introvert, Bedouine prefers anonymity but loves making music enough to share hers with anyone willing to listen -- even if it means confronting her fears. An aversion to the spotlight led her away from the stage for several years, where she worked from the shadows, composing music for independent films and art installations until something unexpected happened -- she wound up in Los Angeles and experienced the opposite of the cliché.\"The joy I get from making music has nothing to do with any kind of recognition,\" Bedouine says, \"so when I moved to L.A., I had no intention of pursuing music as a career. But then I started meeting so many inspiring people -- talented musicians who were living these double lives, going out on the road with successful bands and playing stadiums, and then coming home to this amazing scene and playing all these great little clubs and bars. It made the idea of starting over with my music less intimidating, and it made me more comfortable with the idea of performing. L.A. actually made me less jaded.\"She soon fell in with the tight-knit community of performers in her Echo Park neighborhood, spending nights trading songs and listening to records with some of L.A.'s best underground artists. \"One of my favorite ways to hang out with people,\" Bedouine says, \"is to take turns listening to each other's music, bouncing ideas back and forth.\"It was on just such a night that she met collaborator Jake Blanton (The Killers, Father John Misty, Jenny O.), with whom she would record the songs for her new self-titled EP.The two co-wrote \"The City,\" and put together a short yet memorable set of songs propelled by insistent, mesmerizing beats, and anchored by chiming guitar, daydreamy piano and above all, Bedouine's unforgettable voice. Impressionistic, her languid vocals swirl into the ether, another color in the palette, another instrument in the band. Her words roll soft off the tongue, careful brushstrokes, oil paint swept across a canvas. The music is beautiful and striking, always revelling quietly in its search for some enigmatic unknown just out of reach. There is no ego here, no filter between Bedouine's heart and her songs.\n\nMORE EVENT INFO:\n- We have a mix of normal chairs, some tall chairs, and standing room in back if the show sells out.- Seating is not reserved.- Fremont Abbey is ADA accessible on either level.- We are an all ages venue. - Please refrain from talking or texting during the show.- Kids 10 & under are free at Abbey Arts concerts & arts events unless noted.\n\nABBEY ARTS, SEATTLE | NONPROFIT 501C3, NON-RELIGIOUS, EST. 2005Presenting welcoming music, arts & cultural experiences for people of all ages & incomes.\nWe support low income families, veterans, and humanitarian nonprofit workers with free event tickets. http://www.fremontabbey.org/artsconnect  \nVenue rental info & more: http://www.fremontabbey.org/rent Concert & events calendar: http://www.abbeyarts.me\n Home Venue: Fremont Abbey, 4272 Fremont Ave North, Seattle, WA 98103 / 206-414-8325 Ballard Homestead: 6541 Jones Ave NW, Seattle\n\nAll ticket sales are final.", "user_id"=>1}}

With inspirations far afield from music - a painting, the weather, a dream - in her craft, Chloé Herry’s derivations are difficult to trace.

But art’s ability to transport others is this talented producer’s special magic - manifest whenever someone presses play.\nIn the way the clean curve of a Japanese roof is understated and exotic, CloZee pulls her power from a bold simplicity. Her classical guitar roots allow her an informed, melodic space that draws influence from flamenco to edIT of The Glitch Mob. This melting pot of instrumentation and cinematic flair puts listeners in a mood to move, with international crowds now cultivating the evolution of her genre. Chloé says she rarely lays down only electronic sounds. Her favorite sources are organic and real.\nTo describe her life, CloZee grins and dramatizes her mind exploding. With traction growing stateside, she is set to expand far beyond the transformational festivals and tours where she grew the same roots that nourished Bassnectar, Beats Antique, and Bonobo.

Andwith the second half of the band’s third studio album, PLUMP, on the horizon, the band’s careercontinues to catapult forward.

The completion of PLUMP istimely, coming at a moment when the band’s fervent fan base is at an all-time high andexpanding rapidly.\nIn the live setting, more and more people are invigorated by Twiddle’s community, promotingpositivity and the band’s skillful improvisational music.

Early childhood photos reveal Rain sitting at the piano plinking keys, grinning from ear to ear... a true sign of things to come. Continuing his early fascination with music, Rain was later drawn to electronic music, inspired by its ability to combine the best of organically played instruments and the synthetic pleasures of sounds more exotic to the human ear. After beginning a DJ career in the 90s, Rain began incorporating the music he was making in his home studio into his DJ sets. That was all it took to trigger a full blown love affair with electronic music and the process of its creation... and Phutureprimitive was born. \nPhutureprimitive's music is singular and unique in its approach. Lush melodies drift across intricate rhythms, groove heavy beats and warm, fuzzy bass lines. Often exploring a dark and dense palette, his music also manages to convey a sense of tranquility and beauty, engaging the listener into hypnotic movement and often escalating into a full-on kinetic experience. Shimmering with cinematic qualities, his music ultimately speaks to the body, mind and soul. \nDespite electronic music's tendency to suffer a short shelf life, Phutureprimitive has already demonstrated a timeless quality with his debut album \"Sub Conscious\" on Waveform Records, which remains the top seller on the label since its release in 2004, obtaining a cult status among fans and collectors. With a string of singles released in the interim on various labels, the birth of Native Harmonix (Rain’s own Record Label) brought us the “Luminous” EP in 2010; delving into a lyrical based production, supported by undulating synth work and a palpable haunting texture throughout. His second full-length release “Kinetik” forged new territories of emotional electronic dance music, exploring a heavier, bass-centric sound that adds raw energy to intricately detailed tracks. \"Kinetik\" still remains on the iTunes Top 100 Electronic Music Chart, 3 years after its release. \nWith a new collection of songs released in 2 parts titled “Searching for Beauty in the Darkest Places,” he takes ideas from his previous releases and supercharges them with hard-hitting dancefloor appeal, while maintaining the depth and prowess this trusted producer is so well known for. His first national headlining tour in Fall 2013 debuted with multi-media production team Vinton Depiction & Michael Miller, the animation/visual effects creator behind NBC's \"Grimm.\" The Dance Out Your Demons Tour featured an interactive game with the audience, where the audience members write down a \"demon,\" fear, or something they are letting go of on a piece of duct tape, stick it to the bottom of their shoe, then \"dance out their demons.\" Due to the smashing success of DOYD, Phutureprimitive announced that they will continue to incorporate it on future tours. \n\n\nPAPADOSIO\nWebsite\nFalling somewhere between rock, jazz and electronic mayhem we find space rock. This is a genre that is not readily defined, and is a state of mind as much as it could be considered a genre. This range of frequencies is where Papadosio tends to spend their time, sometimes dining in deep space, and other times snacking right on your front porch. Papadosio strives to create music that is strangely familiar, and calls all walks of humanity to bask in a unique experience celebrating the one constant in an ever changing world: music. \nJoin Papadosio in an effort to create, augment, and rejoice in the universal language of music.

As a long time staple on the touring circuit of the Pacific Northwest, the sextet has spent the past three years expanding their region and is a recognizable touring machine on the West Coast, British Columbia, and out through Colorado and the Southwestern United States. Formed in 2002 from basement jam-session beginnings, original members Andy Pritiken (guitar/lead vocals), Sam Lax (Saxophone/Percussion/Vocals), Todd Benedict (Drums), and former member Kale McGuinness (Bass) came together in the most incubescent way. Not one member had played in any organized musical group. For this reason they chose the name Acorn Project in 2004 symbolizing their collective effort to grow as a musical entity with focus and dedication for their passion for live music. Additions were made including Oskar Kollen (Keys/Vocals 2005), and long time guest musician and virtuoso Tristan Curran (Lead Guitar/Vocals 2006), bringing the bands sound to new heights. Scott Vaillancourt (Bass 2010) and Kevin Chryst aka KREESTOE recently replaced the original McGuinness/Benedict rhythm section and have efficiently adopted Acorn’s repertoire. The dynamic and charging new rhythm section rounds out the current six-piece ensemble as they continue to produce an irresistibly unique sound with the same focus, dedication, and dream-worthy energy of their beginnings, and current aspirations of becoming an established national touring act. “Acorn Project, who conjures up the appealing marriage of mid-period Pink Floyd, early Radiohead and the blues-jazz-dub whap of Morphine… cuts a broad cloth that could fit classic rockers, jam fans, and jazz heads with taste for prog. Often mélanges of this kind come out mushy and indistinct, too many ingredients dulling the sharpness of individual elements, but Acorn’s production and arrangement savvy keep things bright and together throughout. A hard touring bunch… unlike many road dogs, they clearly know their way around a studio, too.”-Dennis Cook – Jambase (Editor)www.dirtyimpound.comOctober 20th, 2010Acorn Project’s debut album “We’ll Be Fine,” released in May of 2006 quickly spread their music around the nation. The album charted as high as #5 on the jambands.com national index, and #4 on CMJ charts throughout the country. Eartaste.com rated it one of the top 12 albums of the year, and great reviews flooded in from all parts of the U.S. and Europe. “We’ll Be Fine” took home the album of the year award in the 2008 What’s Up Awards sponsored by What’s Up Magazine.Their sophmore studio effort “Generation Debt,” was released in September 2010 and improves where “We’ll Be Fine” left off. Debuting at #1 on jambands.com national radio chart and holding in the top 25 for nearly three months, Debt has escalated Acorn Project’s national recognition and impressed critics with “a swinging, sensual mood prevailing in a darkly thoughtful set of songs.” Generation Debt is an intricately written and cohesively designed album that is simply perfect for it’s time. Boasting an impressive resume, high profile performances are common for Acorn Project. Since fall of 2007 the band has performed with seasoned professionals such as Widespread Panic, Tea Leaf Green, EOTO, RAQ, Zilla, BLVD, Hot Buttered Rum, The Bridge, Blue Turtle Seduction, Izabella, Flowmotion, The Everyone Orchestra, Kyle Hollingsworth, Steve Kimock, David Grisman, and The Motet. Acorn has been welcomed to world-renowned festivals and premier venues alike; attention promoters: whether you’re looking for a late-night set filled with live electro-funk and trance instrumentals, or a polished and high energy main stage act, their live performance and expressive light production will never disappoint! The Santa Cruz Metro perhaps stated it best in their show preview from 2008:“While classic jam bands are a dime a dozen; indie rock jam bands are slightly more expensive. Bellingham, Washington’s Acorn Project gives listeners their money’s worth with funky epics that rock enough to make a good Christmas present for your Deadhead uncle but are jazzy enough to play for your hipster friends… Constantly changing and seldom boring, this is a show not to be missed.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwindler\nWebsite\n\n\n\n\n\n", "user_id"=>1}}

Acorn has been welcomed to world-renowned festivals and premier venues alike; attention promoters: whether you’re looking for a late-night set filled with live electro-funk and trance instrumentals, or a polished and high energy main stage act, their live performance and expressive light production will never disappoint! The Santa Cruz Metro perhaps stated it best in their show preview from 2008:“While classic jam bands are a dime a dozen; indie rock jam bands are slightly more expensive. Bellingham, Washington’s Acorn Project gives listeners their money’s worth with funky epics that rock enough to make a good Christmas present for your Deadhead uncle but are jazzy enough to play for your hipster friends… Constantly changing and seldom boring, this is a show not to be missed.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwindler\nWebsite\n\n\n\n\n\n"], ["created_at", "2017-09-11 22:28:16.850289"], ["updated_at", "2017-09-11 22:28:16.850289"], ["user_id", 1]]

Booths 1-6 seat two to four people, booth 7 seats five and booth 8 seats six to eight.\nAll table reservations are now made at checkout. \n\n\nBooth reservations are sold on a first come first serve basis.\n\n\nReserve multiple booths for larger parties and we will seat you together.\n\n\nSee \"Additional Items\" on the bottom of checkout page for available booths. If you do not see “Additional Items” unfortunately all booths are SOLD OUT.\n\n\nWe try our best to guarantee your reservation all night, though we ask you to arrive within 2 hours after doors open.\n\n\nWe no longer reserve high top tables behind booths but we encourage people to arrive early to claim available space.\n\n\nWe offer food service once doors officially open.  See listing above for specific door time.\n\n\n\nCLOZEE\nSoundcloud\n\nIn a feedback loop of adventure, music, and love, CloZee and her fans are ready to let the force of the sound carry everyone to places they have never been before. Being based simultaneously in Toulouse, France and on stages across the world makes this electronic musician stand out. With inspirations far afield from music - a painting, the weather, a dream - in her craft, Chloé Herry’s derivations are difficult to trace. Under the broad structure of electronic and bass music, and informed by sound the world over, Clozee finds her best fit in World Bass’ corner.\nCloZee has performed on many continents: from Coachella to India, on four US Tours, and everywhere around her native France. She is a standout on the roster of her labels, Gravitas Recordings & Otodayo Records. Followers in many languages drive streams counted in millions. But art’s ability to transport others is this talented producer’s special magic - manifest whenever someone presses play.\nIn the way the clean curve of a Japanese roof is understated and exotic, CloZee pulls her power from a bold simplicity. Her classical guitar roots allow her an informed, melodic space that draws influence from flamenco to edIT of The Glitch Mob. This melting pot of instrumentation and cinematic flair puts listeners in a mood to move, with international crowds now cultivating the evolution of her genre. Chloé says she rarely lays down only electronic sounds. Her favorite sources are organic and real.\nTo describe her life, CloZee grins and dramatizes her mind exploding. With traction growing stateside, she is set to expand far beyond the transformational festivals and tours where she grew the same roots that nourished Bassnectar, Beats Antique, and Bonobo. CloZee is breaking through the canopy and into the sun. Come see her fly\n\n\n\n\n", "user_id"=>1}}

Being based simultaneously in Toulouse, France and on stages across the world makes this electronic musician stand out. With inspirations far afield from music - a painting, the weather, a dream - in her craft, Chloé Herry’s derivations are difficult to trace. Under the broad structure of electronic and bass music, and informed by sound the world over, Clozee finds her best fit in World Bass’ corner.\nCloZee has performed on many continents: from Coachella to India, on four US Tours, and everywhere around her native France. She is a standout on the roster of her labels, Gravitas Recordings & Otodayo Records. Followers in many languages drive streams counted in millions. But art’s ability to transport others is this talented producer’s special magic - manifest whenever someone presses play.\nIn the way the clean curve of a Japanese roof is understated and exotic, CloZee pulls her power from a bold simplicity. Her classical guitar roots allow her an informed, melodic space that draws influence from flamenco to edIT of The Glitch Mob. This melting pot of instrumentation and cinematic flair puts listeners in a mood to move, with international crowds now cultivating the evolution of her genre. Chloé says she rarely lays down only electronic sounds. Her favorite sources are organic and real.\nTo describe her life, CloZee grins and dramatizes her mind exploding. With traction growing stateside, she is set to expand far beyond the transformational festivals and tours where she grew the same roots that nourished Bassnectar, Beats Antique, and Bonobo. CloZee is breaking through the canopy and into the sun. Come see her fly\n\n\n\n\n"], ["created_at", "2017-09-11 23:05:43.017801"], ["updated_at", "2017-09-11 23:05:43.017801"], ["user_id", 1]]

Early childhood photos reveal Rain sitting at the piano plinking keys, grinning from ear to ear... a true sign of things to come. Continuing his early fascination with music, Rain was later drawn to electronic music, inspired by its ability to combine the best of organically played instruments and the synthetic pleasures of sounds more exotic to the human ear. After beginning a DJ career in the 90s, Rain began incorporating the music he was making in his home studio into his DJ sets. That was all it took to trigger a full blown love affair with electronic music and the process of its creation... and Phutureprimitive was born. \nPhutureprimitive's music is singular and unique in its approach. Lush melodies drift across intricate rhythms, groove heavy beats and warm, fuzzy bass lines. Often exploring a dark and dense palette, his music also manages to convey a sense of tranquility and beauty, engaging the listener into hypnotic movement and often escalating into a full-on kinetic experience. Shimmering with cinematic qualities, his music ultimately speaks to the body, mind and soul. \nDespite electronic music's tendency to suffer a short shelf life, Phutureprimitive has already demonstrated a timeless quality with his debut album \"Sub Conscious\" on Waveform Records, which remains the top seller on the label since its release in 2004, obtaining a cult status among fans and collectors. With a string of singles released in the interim on various labels, the birth of Native Harmonix (Rain’s own Record Label) brought us the “Luminous” EP in 2010; delving into a lyrical based production, supported by undulating synth work and a palpable haunting texture throughout. His second full-length release “Kinetik” forged new territories of emotional electronic dance music, exploring a heavier, bass-centric sound that adds raw energy to intricately detailed tracks. \"Kinetik\" still remains on the iTunes Top 100 Electronic Music Chart, 3 years after its release. \nWith a new collection of songs released in 2 parts titled “Searching for Beauty in the Darkest Places,” he takes ideas from his previous releases and supercharges them with hard-hitting dancefloor appeal, while maintaining the depth and prowess this trusted producer is so well known for. His first national headlining tour in Fall 2013 debuted with multi-media production team Vinton Depiction & Michael Miller, the animation/visual effects creator behind NBC's \"Grimm.\" The Dance Out Your Demons Tour featured an interactive game with the audience, where the audience members write down a \"demon,\" fear, or something they are letting go of on a piece of duct tape, stick it to the bottom of their shoe, then \"dance out their demons.\" Due to the smashing success of DOYD, Phutureprimitive announced that they will continue to incorporate it on future tours. \n\n\nPAPADOSIO\nWebsite\nFalling somewhere between rock, jazz and electronic mayhem we find space rock. This is a genre that is not readily defined, and is a state of mind as much as it could be considered a genre. This range of frequencies is where Papadosio tends to spend their time, sometimes dining in deep space, and other times snacking right on your front porch.

Every song on the album inverts a hoary hip-hop cliché. With classics like “Oh Shit,” “Otha Fish”, “Ya’ Mama,” and hit single, “Passing Me By,” it is not surprising that it shipped over a million units, garnered comparisons to De La Soul and Tribe Called Quest, and everyone from Pitchfork Media to The Source has hailed it as one of the greatest albums ever made. Speaking on the passage of time, their second release “LabCabInCalifornia” has revealed exactly how far-reaching The Pharcyde’s vision was. From enlisting a young and then unknown James Yancey aka J DILLA to produce beats, the classic “Runnin” to collaborating with director Spike Jonze (“Being John Malkovich” “Adaptation”) on the video for “Drop,” it has consistently reinforced their steadfast refusal to tread familiar artistic grounds.Today, The Pharcyde is still performing and touring the globe. They continue to hone their individual abilities yet carry on the name & legacy in its original fashion. They still seduce their audience with the same boyish charm that founded them at the beginning. Now, it’s combined with the knowledge that has been bestowed upon them as men who have taken on, and rose to the challenge of the rap game.

This melting pot of instrumentation and cinematic flair puts listeners in a mood to move, with international crowds now cultivating the evolution of her genre. Chloé says she rarely lays down only electronic sounds. Her favorite sources are organic and real.\nTo describe her life, CloZee grins and dramatizes her mind exploding.

Backed by the hot, gritty orchestration of the 11 member Court Supreme, front man Eldridge Gravy easily works dance floors to a fever pitch with his full-bore performance and smooth rapport with the audience. Their high energy, tight arrangements, and massive stage presence have the power to convince any crowd that funk ain't dead.EG&tCS is currently releasing singles and videos for their highly anticipated fourth studio album, which is slated to be released in the fall of 2016. The entire album is being summoned to tape in their clandestine, subterranean studio by up & coming producer Jason Gray of The Polyrythmics. Over the past ten years, EG&tCS has played sold-out shows at every prestigious venue in Seattle & Portland, including Crocodile, Neumos, Tractor Tavern, Showbox, Doug Fir Lounge, Goodfoot, and the Star Theater. They have also ruthlessly funked thousands of festival-goers at Bumbershoot, Waterfront Blues Festival, Timber, Summer Meltdown, and July 4th at Gasworks Park.The band, like so many of it's members, is the product of a wonderful accident. Early in 2006, in what was supposed to be a one-off event, an instrumental band teamed up with a guest singer to learn some James Brown and Parliament covers for a moving-out party. The next morning, the house was torn up; shattered glass was all over the floor, tables were broken, and the landlord was on his way for the final walk-through.

Early childhood photos reveal Rain sitting at the piano plinking keys, grinning from ear to ear... a true sign of things to come. Continuing his early fascination with music, Rain was later drawn to electronic music, inspired by its ability to combine the best of organically played instruments and the synthetic pleasures of sounds more exotic to the human ear. After beginning a DJ career in the 90s, Rain began incorporating the music he was making in his home studio into his DJ sets. That was all it took to trigger a full blown love affair with electronic music and the process of its creation... and Phutureprimitive was born. \nPhutureprimitive's music is singular and unique in its approach. Lush melodies drift across intricate rhythms, groove heavy beats and warm, fuzzy bass lines. Often exploring a dark and dense palette, his music also manages to convey a sense of tranquility and beauty, engaging the listener into hypnotic movement and often escalating into a full-on kinetic experience. Shimmering with cinematic qualities, his music ultimately speaks to the body, mind and soul. \nDespite electronic music's tendency to suffer a short shelf life, Phutureprimitive has already demonstrated a timeless quality with his debut album \"Sub Conscious\" on Waveform Records, which remains the top seller on the label since its release in 2004, obtaining a cult status among fans and collectors. With a string of singles released in the interim on various labels, the birth of Native Harmonix (Rain’s own Record Label) brought us the “Luminous” EP in 2010; delving into a lyrical based production, supported by undulating synth work and a palpable haunting texture throughout. His second full-length release “Kinetik” forged new territories of emotional electronic dance music, exploring a heavier, bass-centric sound that adds raw energy to intricately detailed tracks. \"Kinetik\" still remains on the iTunes Top 100 Electronic Music Chart, 3 years after its release. \nWith a new collection of songs released in 2 parts titled “Searching for Beauty in the Darkest Places,” he takes ideas from his previous releases and supercharges them with hard-hitting dancefloor appeal, while maintaining the depth and prowess this trusted producer is so well known for. His first national headlining tour in Fall 2013 debuted with multi-media production team Vinton Depiction & Michael Miller, the animation/visual effects creator behind NBC's \"Grimm.\" The Dance Out Your Demons Tour featured an interactive game with the audience, where the audience members write down a \"demon,\" fear, or something they are letting go of on a piece of duct tape, stick it to the bottom of their shoe, then \"dance out their demons.\" Due to the smashing success of DOYD, Phutureprimitive announced that they will continue to incorporate it on future tours. \n\n\nPAPADOSIO\nWebsite\nFalling somewhere between rock, jazz and electronic mayhem we find space rock.

Their high energy, tight arrangements, and massive stage presence have the power to convince any crowd that funk ain't dead.EG&tCS is currently releasing singles and videos for their highly anticipated fourth studio album, which is slated to be released in the fall of 2016. The entire album is being summoned to tape in their clandestine, subterranean studio by up & coming producer Jason Gray of The Polyrythmics. Over the past ten years, EG&tCS has played sold-out shows at every prestigious venue in Seattle & Portland, including Crocodile, Neumos, Tractor Tavern, Showbox, Doug Fir Lounge, Goodfoot, and the Star Theater. They have also ruthlessly funked thousands of festival-goers at Bumbershoot, Waterfront Blues Festival, Timber, Summer Meltdown, and July 4th at Gasworks Park.The band, like so many of it's members, is the product of a wonderful accident. Early in 2006, in what was supposed to be a one-off event, an instrumental band teamed up with a guest singer to learn some James Brown and Parliament covers for a moving-out party. The next morning, the house was torn up; shattered glass was all over the floor, tables were broken, and the landlord was on his way for the final walk-through.
